# Melofie - Music Player Website

As part of learning to code,I completed a project that involved creating Melofie - Music Player Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was designed to showcase my skills in front-end web development.It is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to play music.I used HTML and CSS to design and style the interface, and I implemented JavaScript to handle user input and interaction such as basic playback controls -play, pause, and next.I also gained experience working with version control tools such as Git and GitHub.

## Responsive Design:

The application prioritizes user experience by incorporating a responsive design. This ensures seamless accessibility and functionality across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.


## Access the Application:

- To explore and experience the project firsthand, users can visit the project at the following link: [Music Player](). The link provides direct access to the project, enabling users to navigate through its functionalities and enjoy a customized music playback experience.

- In summary, the project is not just a music player but a comprehensive web development project showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It prioritizes user experience with responsive design, interactive controls, and audio streaming, offering an independent and enjoyable music listening experience. ðŸŽµðŸ’»ðŸ”€ðŸ”Š
